# Discord-Bot-with-Nodejs

This is a simple application where I created a bot for a Discord server. The bot listens to messages from users in the server and responds with custom replies based on those messages. Additionally, I implemented custom commands that users can use within Discord to interact with the bot in specific ways.

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Discord bot with Node.js to automate responses and enhance user interaction within a Discord server.
